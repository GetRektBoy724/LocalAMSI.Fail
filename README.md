# LocalAMSI.Fail
This is a port of AMSI.fail,i modify the code to make it C# 5 compatible and can be executed on Windows 10 without installing any extra requirements.For more info,visit [amsi.fail github repo](https://github.com/Flangvik/AMSI.fail) and visit [amsi.fail live working PoC](https://amsi.fail).
# Usage
you can compile it using Windows 10's built-in csc.exe which is located on `"C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\<version>\csc.exe"`.
you can also use the pre-compiled binary which is in a form of library/DLL.For the DLL,you can load it on powershell directly using `[Reflection.Assembly]`
# Notes
- This code is not flagged as malicious (idk why) nor the pre-compiled binary,so you can execute it anywhere you want.
- the Pre-Compiled binary is not injected with anything malicious nor slipped with malicious code,so dont even think of me get a meterpreter shell from the computer you load the dll ðŸ˜‚
- I call this "LocalAMSI.Fail" cause we dont need to access the AMSI.fail API to get the AMSI bypass,instead of that,we load the AMSI.fail code locally and generate the AMSI bypass locally
- Cause i modify the AMSI Bypass a little,i create my own "Online" AMSI.Fail and you can access it by invoking the "OnlineAMSIFail.ps1" script
